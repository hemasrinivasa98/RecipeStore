# RecipeStore
Web application to hold cooking recipes. Very much a work in progress and not reflective of the final product.

Built using ASP.NET MVC with Entity Framework. 

<hr>
##Planned:

1. Ability to scrape recipes from popular NZ chefs (In-progress)
2. Filtering options on recipe page to search for categories, serving size, prep time and more.
3. Tidy up UI for better experience on Mobile.
