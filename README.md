# RecipeStore
Web application to hold cooking recipes. Built using ASP.NET MVC with Entity Framework, with HTMLAgilityPack for web scraping. 

Currently on hold while studying. A port will probably be done using Golang or Python.

## Planned:

1. Ability to scrape recipes from popular NZ chefs (In-progress, Nadia Lim and Annabel Langbein are functional)
2. Filtering options on recipe page to search for categories, serving size, prep time and more.
3. Tidy up UI for better experience on Mobile.
